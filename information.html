        Did you know? The Dutch were the first to transport and cultivate coffee
        commercially…all because they smuggled a coffee plant out of the
        unyielding Arab port in 1690! With this single act of rebellion, they
        grew coffee in large amounts and helped cement a trading center in
        Amsterdam. They soon became known among the European royals for their
        coffee gifts. One such recipient was Louis XIV who planted and
        cultivated his “Noble Tree” in the royal gardens in 1714. High-spirited
        and full of flavor, the jovial nature of coffee inspired others to
        spread the joy (even at the risk of rebelling!) While on leave in Paris,
        a naval officer stole a sprout and transported it back to Martinique.
        This one particular tree is believed to be the father of many Coffea
        arabica trees alive today in the former French colonies of Central and
        Latin America. In 1727, an opportunity arose when Brazilian Lieutenant
        Colonel Francisco de Melo Palheta was sent to resolve a conflict between
        the French and Dutch colonies in Guiana. Amidst his affair with the wife
        of French Guiana’s governor, she presented M. Palheta with a farewell
        bouquet where she concealed fertile seeds of coffee. These seeds would
        turn Brazil into one of the world’s largest coffee-producing countries!
        Coffee now became a drink of the people. This was the first step that
        helped bring coffee to us, to you, and the world. As you sip on your
        beloved brew in your signature Starbucks cup, you appreciate the value
        of a good cup of coffee — but you don’t always get the opportunity to
        reflect on everything that went into bringing that to you. That’s what
        we’re hoping to change with this mini-series.
